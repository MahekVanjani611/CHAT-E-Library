It uses a distributed hash table to store metadata about the documents in the library, and it uses a peer-to-peer network to distribute the load of processing queries. | Llama is lightweight and scalable, making it a good choice for managing large digital libraries. | Distributed hash table, peer-to-peer network | Further research is needed to evaluate the performance of Llama on large-scale digital libraries. | [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223904.223914](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223904.223914) |\n",
